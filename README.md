# Gopher-Game
This app is a simple game where two algorithms play against each other to find a hidden gopher on a 10x10 grid. The app has two game modes: continuous play and guess mode. In continuous play, the algorithms take turns making guesses until the gopher is found. In guess mode, the algorithms have a limited number of guesses before the game ends.
